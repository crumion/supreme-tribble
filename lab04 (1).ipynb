    "<font color=\"red\">Though these programs function similarly, they complete the task differently and at different speeds. The way these algrioms are structured affect how long they take to complete. With the first activity, the program is moving through each index until it finds a match with a word that it has stored. This was elementary and took the longest to complete, as it was the slowest complexity 0(n) at 38.9 nanoseconds. With activity 2, the program worked similarly to the first, but the index was sorted with lowercase letters and stored the checking varaible differently from its list length. This speed up the algorithim to 37.4 nanoseconds. For activity 3, the index was splited, sorted, and then converted into binary. This allowed wordindex and found to search through the string. This was a lot faster, at 31.7 nanoseconds. Algorithmic complexity changes the speed needed to complete the task, and efficiency. With a different type of data, linear search may be more useful, and at smaller volumes. Each technique has its own place to find and sort through matches of data. </font>"
